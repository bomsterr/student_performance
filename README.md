# Introduction
It is pivotal to encourage and support worldwide education, especially those of younger generations. There are some challenges that play an subtle but influential role in affecting children's ability to get a good education. Good education can be captured differently but in this analysis, the test scores (math, reading, and writing) will be the quantitative values which will measure children's academic performance. Some factors that influence children's ability to learn in schools could stem from variety of reasons ranging from parents' education level, the family's financial status, ethnicity, and so forth. The purpose of this jupyter notebook is to predict features that can predict what factors could influence students' academic performances.
